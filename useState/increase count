-Hooks is a function we just need to call them.

-Hooks is a function that accept argument which is initial value of the state and return the current value of the propertie and method that is capable 

of updating that state propertie.

**count is initial state

**setCount method which will update the state.


import React, { useState } from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>{count}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click</button>
    </div>
  );
}
const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
ReactDOM.render(<App />, rootElement);
;
